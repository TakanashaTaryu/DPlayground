# D'Playground - A 23' Assistants Project

![](public/d-playground-logo.svg)

Not really serious, just making it for a joke.

FR would be funny if running a C compiler, a Python interpreter, and a Linux VM was possible in a browser (spoiler alert yes it is and with a lot of pain to boot with)

## Getting Started

Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en) (it comes with npm installed). 

_Optionally install your favorite package manager (yarn, pnpm, bun, or don't)_

If you're on Windows, download [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Clone the repository and get inside it:
```bash
git clone -b gimmick https://github.com/TakanashaTaryu/DPlayground/
cd DPlayground
```

Download libraries and dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
